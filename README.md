# Plagiarism Detection Tool
The Java client that brings reports from 2 well-known plagiarism tools: MOOS and JPlag \
To make it work, you need to set up both tools locally on your machine:
  - for JPlag, just ```.jar``` file(that already in repo) needs to be stored in the same folder, so, just clone the repo with it
  - for MOSS, you need to register and setup the tool manually \

     **note** that the script (**moss.pl**) needs to be stored in the project folder
